        <h1>Research Game</h1>
        <hr>
        <h3 id="StuckInSpace"><i>StuckInSpace</i> - VR Multi-Modal Co-op two player game</h3>
        <div>
            I created this game for my research into multi-modality and co-presence in VR.
            It's a two player co-op game where the VR player and the second non-VR player have to help eachother to fix
            the spaceship.
            The second player can either use a PC (the normal way) or a smartphone through a novel approach using one of the
            HTC Vive controllers that sends information about the exact position in VR space to the phone and then
            renders it like a "window" into the VR world.
            <br>
            Currently there is no way to download the game as I am still working on it, but you can see some screenshots of the game and the hardware setup below:

        <h1>COMP3218: Game Design and Development</h1>
        <hr>
        These two games are two of the three games that were part of the coursework for COMP3218.
        <br>
        <h3><i>Bingo Bongo</i> - Coursework 1 "Fundamentals of Game Design" (make a tutorial level)</h3>
        <div>
            This game is a local co-op multiplayer in the theme of Ying-Yang (hence the name). It was created by my
            friend and me for the first coursework, "Tutorial".
            It's supposed to be played by two people on the same keyboard, and each player controls either the white or
            black rectangle, which have special abilities that have to be used to help the other player complete the
            level.
            <br>
            You can download the game and check some more screenshot on my itch.io page for the game <a

        <h3><i>008: VR Extravaganza</i> - Coursework 3 "Innovation in Games" (use a new technology to make a game)</h3>
        <div>
            This is one of my favourite games that I made, mostly for the fact that it uses a real voice actor and he
            did an amazing job with that (check him out <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/share/0eLQQ2">here</a>).
            It was created solely by me, and is inspired by games like "I Expect You To Die" and "The Stanley Parable" -
            the voice you hear in your ear is supposed to be the thing that agents hear when they're on a mission.
            <br>
            The mechanic itself, slowing down time and being shot by bullets is close to what "Super Hot" does, but I
            went for a more controlled slow down by pressing a button and having limited time to do that.
            You have to take bullets that you've frozen in time and try to make the shoot the targets.
            <br>
            To download it an try it (it's only for VR and it's tested only on the Vive controllers), check out <a

        <h1>Game Jam games</h1>
        <hr>
        These are the games that I have created on some of the Game Jams that I have been to the past few years.


        <br>
        <h3><i>The Oracle</i> - Southampton Game Jam 2020@Home</h3>
        <div>
            This game was created at the beginning of the pandemic, and showcases a couple of mechanics that I find very
            interesting to use - manipulation of windows and some other tricks that I don't want to spoil.
            Created in Godot, it was my first time using that engine and it's a very lightweight and useful game engine.
            <br>
            You can check out an in-depth description and a download link to play it at its itch.io (available only for
            Windows, sorry): <a href="https://ioiototm.itch.io/the-oracle">https://ioiototm.itch.io/the-oracle</a>.
        </div>

        <br>

        <h3><i>The Artifact</i> - Southampon Game Jam 2021@Home</h3>
        <div>
            Similar to last year's game, this game uses a mechanic that I discovered in Windows that makes for an
            interesting exerience (although, I only tested it on Windows 10 and some configurations don't work as well
            on older versions).
            <br>
