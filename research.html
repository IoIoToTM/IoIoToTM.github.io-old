                    This was part of the Doctoral Consortium of CHI PLAY in 2020, in which a short summary of the work that was done and the future direction of my PhD was discussed, as well as a short 5 minute video that was presented at the online conference.

                    This paper covers an experiment that was undertook to see the difference between two ways of addign a second player to a VR game - through either a Phone or a PC. 
                    Co-Presence and Immersion were used as variables to test for a difference, and in the end the only difference was that the VR player has more immersion. 
                    Later analysis showed that there are more nuances and that each mode has its positives and negatives that need to be taken into account when creating such an experience.
