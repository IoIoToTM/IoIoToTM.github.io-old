	 <a href="https://github.com/IoIoToTM/Digital-Doily"> Digital Doily </a> - This is actually my first Programming II coursework at the university. It's basically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doily">Doily</a> maker, with a few options to change color, size of pen, numbers of refelcted sectors and etc. It's written in Java as we're studying that.

	<p id="PhysicsSquare">
		<a href="PhysicsSquare.html">Physics square</a> is my first try at making something in JavaScript and HTML5. It's kind of a physics simulation (a very simple one), where you control the red square with the arrow/WASD keys or you can drag it with the mouse, and you can change a few options like gravity, the bouncing coefficient (how much it bounces) and a few other option. There is also a WebGL link if you move the square to the left bottom corner, which is a little test with 3D animation I wanted to try. You can try it on this page, click <a href="javascript:void(0)" id='button'>here</a> or in it's original page <a href="PhysicsSquare.html">here</a>.
