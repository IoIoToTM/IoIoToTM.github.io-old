		<a href="https://github.com/IoIoToTM/ImageTransform"> ImageTransform </a> - Done in C++ using SDL, something that I started as a little project and grew to something bigger, with trying to optimize the software rendering as much as I can. I have used a few methods to change an image, but the main algorithm I am testing is for quantization and dithering. You can drag a BMP and it will load it, and then with P or O you can increase or lower number of colors (quantization). I have a few methods that do the same but are there just for benchmarking purposes and seeing what is faster and etc. Testing I have done with up to 8K pictures, and benchmarking how long my CPU proccesses it (techniques I have used include : using cache coherence to minimize cash misses, openMP, multi-threading, SSE and AVX extensions using Intel mnemonics).

		<a href="https://github.com/IoIoToTM/Digital-Doily"> Digital Doily </a> - This is actually my first Programming II coursework at the university. 
		It's basically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doily">Doily</a> maker, with a few options to change color, size of pen, numbers of refelcted sectors and etc.
		It's written in Java as we're studying that. 
		(Download JAR file: <a href="files/Digital Doily.jar">Digital Doily.jar</a>)

		<h1>Physics Square</h1>
		<hr>
		<a href="https://github.com/IoIoToTM/IoIoToTM.github.io/blob/master/PhysicsSquare.html">Physics square</a> is my first try at making something in JavaScript and HTML5. 
		It's kind of a physics simulation (a very simple one), where you control the red square with the arrow/WASD keys or you can drag it with the mouse, and you can change a few options like gravity, the bouncing coefficient (how much it bounces) and a few other option. 
		There is also a WebGL link if you move the square to the left bottom corner, which is a little test with 3D animation I wanted to try. 
		You can try it on this page (click <a href="javascript:void(0)" id='button'>here</a>) or in its original page <a href="PhysicsSquare.html">here</a>.
